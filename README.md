# choose_your_vehicle
Select a vehicle from the terminal!
This program uses Inquirer to accept inputs from the user about a vehicle. They can choose the category (e.g. as car, truck, or motorbike) and add additional details as desired.
They can then choose an action to perform with the vehicle, select another vehicle they have created, or create another one.

Note:
I used sources such as Stack Exchange and GitHub Copilot to help with coding.

Here is a video of the code's usage:
